Created a belly button demographic panel and visualization (bar & bubble chart)of the bacteria data for each volunteer.
A dropdown menu lists the ID numbers of all the volunteers. When a volunteer ID is chosen from the dropdown menu, that person’s demographics information, such as location, sex, and age, will be displayed. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza’s volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.
